In this repo, we explore the grokking phenomenon by expanding the experiments
from the paper
["Grokking as the Transition from Lazy to Rich Training Dynamics"](https://openreview.net/forum?id=vt5mnLVIVo).
and inspecting multiple of the Neural Tangent Kernel when the transition between
lazy training and feature learning happens.

**IMPORTANT!**
If you're using Python >= 3.10 beware! Some of the code might not run and/or you
might find conflicts with the Jax/neural-tangents version. We
recommend using Python 3.9. For reproducibility, we provide a
`requirements.txt`.

The code is based on the experiments code of the paper
["Grokking as the Transition from Lazy to Rich Training Dynamics"](https://openreview.net/forum?id=vt5mnLVIVo).
We thank the authors
for sharing their code in their supplementary material.
